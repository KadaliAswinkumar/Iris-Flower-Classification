# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting the species of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics. The dataset used for this problem is called the Iris dataset, which was first introduced by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936.

The Iris dataset contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of three different species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 data points.

The goal of iris flower classification is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics. This is typically done using a supervised learning algorithm, such as logistic regression, decision tree, or support vector machine.

The Iris dataset is often used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of different classification algorithms. The dataset is small, easy to understand, and has well-defined classes, making it a good starting point for learning classification techniques.

The accuracy of iris flower classification algorithms can vary depending on the specific algorithm and parameter settings used. However, it is generally possible to achieve high levels of accuracy using modern machine learning techniques.

Overall, iris flower classification is a popular and useful problem in the field of machine learning, with many practical applications in biology, ecology, and agriculture.
